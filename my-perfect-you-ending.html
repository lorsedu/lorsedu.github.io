                                            Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."
You can give lots of examples!</a>

                            7. Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."
