sector employment even faster while rapidly raising the incomes of those informally
employed.

Let's measure how well verse you are with the lesson by answering the activity. DIRECTION: Read the case study vigilantly; answer the following questions after analyzing the case. Case Study Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. is the leading wholesale distributor of construction supplies in the Philippines, and one of the country's largest distributors of hardware equipment, tools, and other interior and exterior building commodities and related products. The business started in late 1980's and grown its countrywide organization with more than 369 facilities and branches in most of the cities in the Philippines. The business venture reached over P50 billion sales and has existing four ISO certifications, certificates which issued to companies with enhanced quality management system. It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</a>

I WANT TO BE TALL SOMEDAY: Height Aspirations Among Young People in the Philippines When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve in the Philippines, many children jump as high as they can, believing (with their parents) that it would make them grow taller. In my ethnography, I found many other practices that are believed to boost children's statures when they grow -up, from sleeping in the afternoon to taking popular growth supplements that are overtly marketed with claims that it can make children grow tall. HATCHE What aspirations are embedded in the desire for tallness that informs these practices? I draw from an "ethnography of height" in the city of Puerto Princesa, Western Philippines to look at different domains in society where height "matters", including basketball games and beauty pageants that privilege tall bodies; jobs that explicitly or implicitly demand "height requirements"; public nutrition programs that use children's heights as an index of both individual and national well-being; and the everyday lives of the youths with whom I hung out. These materialities of height in the Philippines, I argue, make it valuable "asset" for young people, and makes explicable young people's aspirations of tallness. But although height emerges as a form of what I call "body capital", there is also a "becoming" in the aspiration of tallness (Biel and Locke, 2010), and therein, I argue, lies the efficacy of height-making practices. Moreover, the desire for tallness can be read as an idiom for young people's desire for better lives. Guide Questions: 1. What is the significance of the study to the following?

Case Study Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. is the leading wholesale distributor of construction supplies in the Philippines, and one of the country's largest distributors of hardware equipment, tools, and other interior and exterior building commodities and related products. The business started in late 1980's and grown its countrywide organization with more than 369 facilities and branches in most of the cities in the Philippines. The business venture reached over P50 billion sales and has existing four ISO certifications, certificates which issued to companies with enhanced quality management system. It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</h2><br />

                            20. Directions: Given research titles and their abstracts below and explain the importance of conducting the study to the different stakeholders. I WANT TO BE TALL SOMEDAY: Height Aspirations Among Young People in the Philippines When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve in the Philippines, many children jump as high as they can, believing (with their parents) that it would make them grow taller. In my ethnography, I found many other practices that are believed to boost children's statures when they grow -up, from sleeping in the afternoon to taking popular growth supplements that are overtly marketed with claims that it can make children grow tall. HATCHE What aspirations are embedded in the desire for tallness that informs these practices? I draw from an "ethnography of height" in the city of Puerto Princesa, Western Philippines to look at different domains in society where height "matters", including basketball games and beauty pageants that privilege tall bodies; jobs that explicitly or implicitly demand "height requirements"; public nutrition programs that use children's heights as an index of both individual and national well-being; and the everyday lives of the youths with whom I hung out. These materialities of height in the Philippines, I argue, make it valuable "asset" for young people, and makes explicable young people's aspirations of tallness. But although height emerges as a form of what I call "body capital", there is also a "becoming" in the aspiration of tallness (Biel and Locke, 2010), and therein, I argue, lies the efficacy of height-making practices. Moreover, the desire for tallness can be read as an idiom for young people's desire for better lives. Guide Questions: 1. What is the significance of the study to the following?
