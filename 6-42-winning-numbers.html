                        <p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The number is <strong>5</strong>. (11 - 6 = 5)</p><p></p><p>2. The number is <strong>15</strong>. (15 - 9 = 6)</p><p></p><p>3. The other number is <strong>8</strong>. (23 - 15 = 8)</p><p></p><p>4. The number is <strong>6</strong>. (42 ÷ 7 = 6)</p><p></p><p>5. The area is 2.25. (Perimeter = 4s, where s is the side length of the square. 9 = 4s, s = 2.25. Area = s² = 2.25² = 5.0625)</p><p></p><p>6. The regular price was <strong>P130</strong>. (Regular price - P10 = P120, Regular price = P130)</p><p></p><p>7. The other item costs <strong>P5</strong>. (P11 + P5 = P16)</p><p></p><p>8. Doy needs <strong>4 more points.</strong> (21 - 17 = 4)</p><p></p><p>9. Lino earns P300 /hour. (P1500 ÷ 5 = P300)</p><p></p><p>10. Arnel bought <strong>3 CDs</strong>. (P900 ÷ P300 = 3)</p><p>1. The number is 5.</p><p>2. The number is 15.</p><p>3. The other number is 8.</p><p>4. The number is 6.</p><p>5. The area is 2.25.</p><p>6. The regular price was 130.</p><p>7. The other item costs 5.</p><p>8. He needs 4 more points to win the set.</p><p>9. Lino earns 300 pesos per hour.</p><p>10. Arnel bought 3 CDs.</p><p></p>Here are the explanations for each answer:<p></p><p>1. If a number increased by 6 is equal to 11, we can subtract 6 from 11 to get the original number: 11 - 6 = 5. Therefore, the number is 5.</p><p>2. If a number decreased by 9 is equal to 6, we can add 9 to 6 to get the original number: 6 + 9 = 15. Therefore, the number is 15.</p><p>3. If the sum of two numbers is 23 and one of the numbers is 15, we can subtract 15 from 23 to get the other number: 23 - 15 = 8. Therefore, the other number is 8.</p><p>4. If the product of a number and 7 is equal to 42, we can divide 42 by 7 to get the number: 42 ÷ 7 = 6. Therefore, the number is 6.</p><p>5. If the perimeter of a square is 9, we can divide 9 by 4 to get the length of each side. 9 ÷ 4 = 2.25. The area of a square is the length of one side squared, so the area is 2.25 x 2.25 = 2.25.</p><p>6. If Mely paid P120 for a shirt that was reduced by P10, we can add P10 to P120 to get the regular price: P120 + P10 = P130. Therefore, the regular price was P130.</p><p>7. If together, two items cost P16 and one item costs P11, we can subtract P11 from P16 to get the cost of the other item: P16 - P11 = P5. Therefore, the other item costs P5.</p><p>8. If Doy now has 17 points and he needs 21 points to win the set, we can subtract 17 from 21 to get how many more points he needs: 21 - 17 = 4. Therefore, he needs 4 more points to win the set.</p><p>9. If Lino earned P1,500 for working 5 hours, we can divide P1,500 by 5 to get how much he earns each hour: P1,500 ÷ 5 = P300. Therefore, Lino earns P300 per hour.</p><p>10. If Arnel spent P900 on CDs that cost P300 each, we can divide P900 by P300 to get how many CDs he bought: P900 ÷ P300 = 3. Therefore, Arnel bought 3 CDs.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Consider</p><p></p><p>•Brainliest - Choose this answer as the best answer if you think it is the most helpful and informative.</p><p></p><p>•Upvote/like - Show appreciation for the answer by clicking the upvote or like button.</p><p></p><p>•Comment/critique - Give constructive feedback on the answer, pointing out what is correct and what can be improved.</p><p></p><p>•Rate - Rate the answer on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how helpful it was.</p><p></p><p>•Follow - Click the "Follow" button to stay updated on future answers and posts by the author.</p><p></p>My goal in brainly is to get Genius<p></p>press Brainliest to support me &lt;3<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ito sagot ko dito friend baka namn parate ako salamat </p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula:</p><p>n C r = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)</p><p></p><p>Where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to be selected.</p><p></p><p>In this case, n = 10 (since there are 10 Math problems), and r = 5 (since we want to select 5 problems).</p><p></p><p>Plugging these values into the formula, we get:</p><p></p><p>10 C 5 = 10! / (5! * (10-5)!) = 252</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there are 252 ways to select 5 problems out of a 10-item Math test.</p><p></p><p>In a 6/42 lottery, there are 42 possible numbers to choose from, and we need to select 6 numbers in a single draw. To find the number of possible combinations, we can again use the combination formula:</p><p>n C r = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)</p><p></p><p>In this case, n = 42 and r = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:</p><p></p><p>42 C 6 = 42! / (6! * (42-6)!) = 5,245,786</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there are 5,245,786 possible combinations of numbers if we want to win a 6/42 lottery.</p><br />
