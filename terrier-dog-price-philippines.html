These gadgets are eleved to help not just in the improvement of the 21st century classroom tot also help in decreasing the heavy burden they carry on their houlders. The use of multimedia technology helps students not only in their academic development but also in the welfare. As books are ignificantly heavy and students carry at least three books a day for five days a week, these takes a toll on their health. Some studies suggest at children carrying heavy loads such as books may result in an asymmetrical angle of the shoulders and neck.

                                            Read the selection and explain how comparison and contrast is shown.(5 points each)Example:1. An experiment with dogs suggests that our canine pals, much like ourselves, differ in their attitude toward life: Some dogs are pessimists while others appear to be optimists. In an experiment at a British veterinary school, researchers placed bowls of food in a regular location and got dogs used to finding their dinner there. The researchers then placed a consistently empty bowl in a separate location with a second, food-filled bowl placed between the two. Some dogs, when led to the empty bowl, would just give up if no food was present. These were the pessimists. The optimists, however, having experienced a reward on previous occasions, would keep looking and eventually locate the bowl in the middle. The dogs labeled pessimistic also grew anxious if separated from their owners. They would bark, chew things, and urinate inappropriately. The optimistic dogs, however, tended to fall asleep when left alone. They also greeted strangers as possible substitute playmates. In contrast, the pessimistic dogs would react to strangers with fear and aggression. Answer; Some dogs are optimists and some are pessimists. They differ in several ways.2. There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment. This process is known as photosynthesis. In contrast, animals, including man, get their food either directly from plants or indirectly by eating animals which have eaten plants. Plants are generally stationary. Animals, on the other hand, can usually move about. In external appearance, plants are usually green. They grow in a branching fashion at their extremities, and their growth continues throughout their lives. Animals, however, are very diverse in their external appearance. Their growth pattern is not limited to their extremities. It is evenly distributed and only occurs in a definite time period. Therefore, the difference between plants and animals is quite significant Answer:3. Although I raised Marcee and Obbie since they were puppies, they have completely diverse personalities. Obbie is a six- year old, male, toy Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one- year old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. On the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone she meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is scolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their lives, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. Answer:​</a>

Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed under the covers every night. On the other hand Obbie will only sleep on the flour, under the bed. Given that they were both treated the same way all their life, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. The paragraph is an example of _________ *

He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons; he es- corted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the sta- ble yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ig- nored, for he was king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included.

Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. on the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone shet meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is acolded.

These gadgets are eleved to help not just in the improvement of the 21st century classroom tot also help in decreasing the heavy burden they carry on their houlders. The use of multimedia technology helps students not only in their academic development but also in the welfare. As books are ignificantly heavy and students carry at least three books a day for five days a week, these takes a toll on their health. Some studies suggest at children carrying heavy loads such as books may result in an asymmetrical angle of the shoulders and neck. Using gadgets to store e ooks and replace physical bound books will help in decreasing the load on the bags they cany The quest for the well-being of the students ontinues. The question is, will technology continue to give more benefits to help in the improvement of students?

                            7. Read the selection and explain how comparison and contrast is shown.(5 points each)Example:1. An experiment with dogs suggests that our canine pals, much like ourselves, differ in their attitude toward life: Some dogs are pessimists while others appear to be optimists. In an experiment at a British veterinary school, researchers placed bowls of food in a regular location and got dogs used to finding their dinner there. The researchers then placed a consistently empty bowl in a separate location with a second, food-filled bowl placed between the two. Some dogs, when led to the empty bowl, would just give up if no food was present. These were the pessimists. The optimists, however, having experienced a reward on previous occasions, would keep looking and eventually locate the bowl in the middle. The dogs labeled pessimistic also grew anxious if separated from their owners. They would bark, chew things, and urinate inappropriately. The optimistic dogs, however, tended to fall asleep when left alone. They also greeted strangers as possible substitute playmates. In contrast, the pessimistic dogs would react to strangers with fear and aggression. Answer; Some dogs are optimists and some are pessimists. They differ in several ways.2. There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment. This process is known as photosynthesis. In contrast, animals, including man, get their food either directly from plants or indirectly by eating animals which have eaten plants. Plants are generally stationary. Animals, on the other hand, can usually move about. In external appearance, plants are usually green. They grow in a branching fashion at their extremities, and their growth continues throughout their lives. Animals, however, are very diverse in their external appearance. Their growth pattern is not limited to their extremities. It is evenly distributed and only occurs in a definite time period. Therefore, the difference between plants and animals is quite significant Answer:3. Although I raised Marcee and Obbie since they were puppies, they have completely diverse personalities. Obbie is a six- year old, male, toy Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one- year old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. On the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone she meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is scolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their lives, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. Answer:​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sample Comparison Paragraph</p><p>    There are three important similarities between The Eastern Woodland Peoples and the Northwest Coast Peoples. First of all, neither group had a written language. The Iroquois relied on oral storytelling to recall their history. Similarly, The Nootka used totem poles and spoken words to tell their story. A second similarity is the way these First Nations traveled in their territory. Both groups relied on canoes- birch bark in the east and cedar in the west. Finally, like the majority of First Nations, both had a respect for nature not found in Western cultures. For example, during a hunt, the hunter would make an offering to the dead animal. He thanked the animal for giving up his life. He hoped the animal would let the other animals know of his generosity so that they would give their lives in the future. In sum, there are many commonalities among first nations despite diverse environments and great distances.</p><br />

Obbie is a six year old male Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one year female Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed under the covers every night. On the other hand Obbie will only sleep on the flour, under the bed. Given that they were both treated the same way all their life, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. The paragraph is an example of _________ *

He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons; he es- corted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the sta- ble yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ig- nored, for he was king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included.
