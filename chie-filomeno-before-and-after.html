Avendaño, Julie Alipala - @inquirerdotnet "Visibly upset" about the missing 23,015 sacks of rice smuggled from Malaysia that the government had earlier seized, President Duterte ordered "an immediate and thorough" investigation of the incident in Zamboanga City."The President was really angry because how do you lose 23,000 sacks?" presidential spokesperson Harry Food Authority (NFA) officer in charge and Customs Commissioner Isidro Lapeña to Roque said on Thursday at a news briefing. Roque said Duterte instructed the National "immediately place on preventive suspension to individuals who may be part of the scheme." He said Lapeña told him his office had administratively relieved Zamboanga district collector Lyceo Martinez and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) police district commander, Filomeno Salazar. The BOC chief also said he had sent a team of investigators to Zamboanga to look into the incident, according to Roque. A crackdown on the smuggling of rice from Malaysia, coupled with the depletion of the rice reserve of the NFA, precipitated a severe rice shortage in Zamboanga City and Tawi-Tawi province. The severe shortage sent prices of commercial rice soaring to P70 a kilogram in Zamboanga City and P80 a kilo in Tawi-Tawi, prompting their respective local governments to declare a state of calamity. Malacañang has acknowledged that the high rice prices pulled down the approval and trust ratings of President Duterte last month. Roque said the relief of Martinez and Salazar was "for the purpose of ensuring they cannot tamper with evidence and they cannot influence the investigation." But he said authorities recovered 16,000 sacks of rice on on Oct. 1. The rice was found over the weekend in the Basulta Traders Corp. warehouse and two other warehouses. 1. What is the news all about? Answer: 2. Who is upset with the sacks of rice being smuggled from Malaysia? Answer: 3. Why was it declared as a "State of Calamity"? Answer: 4.

                            22. LESSON 3 General Program Options ACTIVITY In the following situations, determine the best option for the person. 1. Sheila and her teammates are working on their thesis. Sheila started the Introduction and the others need to contribute simultaneously. They realized printing the thesis everytime there are changes is costly and inefficient. How should they collaborate to save time and money? 2. Michael has twenty study videos that he needs to share to Roy. Since Roy only has a 2GB thumb drive (USB key.) they need to transfer two videos at a time since the files are 900MB each. How should they make their task easier? 3. Mrs. Filomeno asks students to submit their one-page reaction paper via email. However, when she downloaded the files, some files have malware (viruses). She also had difficulty marking the papers as some files were corrupted. How should she ask her students to submit the reaction paper instead? 4. John and his friends are joining a contest and they are required to mail their audio one week ahead. Bryan, who prepared the sound, saved the audio file in a hard drive-but of course, he does not want to mail his hard drive to the contest organizers. How should John submit the audio file?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. To save time and money while collaborating on their thesis, Sheila and her teammates can use a collaborative writing platform or software that allows multiple people to work on the same document simultaneously. There are many options available, such as Google Docs, Microsoft Word Online, Dropbox Paper, and many more. </p><p></p><p>2. By dividing the videos into smaller groups and transferring them two at a time, Michael and Roy can ensure that the files will fit on the 2GB USB drive and can be easily transferred without the need for additional storage devices or splitting the files into smaller parts.</p><p></p><p>3. To avoid the risk of receiving files with malware or corrupted files, Mrs. Filomeno can ask her students to submit their one-page reaction papers through an online platform that allows for secure file sharing.</p><p></p><p>4. To submit the audio file without mailing Bryan's hard drive, John and his friends can consider the following options: </p><p></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Online</strong><strong> </strong><strong>file-sharing</strong><strong> </strong><strong>services</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>File</strong><strong> </strong><strong>transfer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>services</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Email</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Physical</strong><strong> </strong><strong>storage</strong><strong> </strong><strong>devices</strong></p><br />

Avendaño, Julie Alipala - @inquirerdotnet "Visibly upset" about the missing 23,015 sacks of rice smuggled from Malaysia that the government had earlier seized, President Duterte ordered "an immediate and thorough" investigation of the incident in Zamboanga City."The President was really angry because how do you lose 23,000 sacks?" presidential spokesperson Harry Food Authority (NFA) officer in charge and Customs Commissioner Isidro Lapeña to Roque said on Thursday at a news briefing. Roque said Duterte instructed the National "immediately place on preventive suspension to individuals who may be part of the scheme." He said Lapeña told him his office had administratively relieved Zamboanga district collector Lyceo Martinez and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) police district commander, Filomeno Salazar. The BOC chief also said he had sent a team of investigators to Zamboanga to look into the incident, according to Roque. A crackdown on the smuggling of rice from Malaysia, coupled with the depletion of the rice reserve of the NFA, precipitated a severe rice shortage in Zamboanga City and Tawi-Tawi province. The severe shortage sent prices of commercial rice soaring to P70 a kilogram in Zamboanga City and P80 a kilo in Tawi-Tawi, prompting their respective local governments to declare a state of calamity. Malacañang has acknowledged that the high rice prices pulled down the approval and trust ratings of President Duterte last month. Roque said the relief of Martinez and Salazar was "for the purpose of ensuring they cannot tamper with evidence and they cannot influence the investigation." But he said authorities recovered 16,000 sacks of rice on on Oct. 1. The rice was found over the weekend in the Basulta Traders Corp. warehouse and two other warehouses. 1. What is the news all about? Answer: 2. Who is upset with the sacks of rice being smuggled from Malaysia? Answer: 3. Why was it declared as a "State of Calamity"? Answer: 4.
