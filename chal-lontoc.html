                                            Story # 1 One day the Moon, who was a woman named Kabigat, sat out in the yard making a large copper pot. The copper was still soft and pliable like clay, and the woman squatted on the ground with the heavy pot against her knees while she patted and shaped it. Now while she was working a son of Cal-chal, the Sun, came by and stopped to watch her mold the form. Against the inside of the jar she pressed a stone, while on the outside with a wooden paddle dripping with water she pounded and slapped until she had worked down the bulges and formed a smooth surface. The boy was greatly interested in seeing the jar grow larger, more beautiful, and smoother with each stroke, and he stood still for some time. Suddenly the Moon looked up and saw him watching her. Instantly she struck him with her paddle, cutting off his head. Now the Sun was not near, but he knew as soon as the Moon had cut off his son's head. And hurrying to the spot, he put the boy's head back on, and he was alive again. Then the Sun said to the Moon, "You cut off my son's head, and because you did this, ever after on the earth people will cut off each other's heads.​</a>

                                            Story # 1
One day the Moon, who was a woman named Kabigat, sat out in the
yard making a large copper pot. The copper was still soft and pliable like
clay, and the woman squatted on the ground with the heavy pot against
her knees while she patted and shaped it. Now while she was working a
son of Cal-chal, the Sun, came by and stopped to watch her mold the form.
Against the inside of the jar she pressed a stone, while on the outside with
a wooden paddle dripping with water she pounded and slapped until she
had worked down the bulges and formed a smooth surface. The boy was
greatly interested in seeing the jar grow larger, more beautiful, and
smoother with each stroke, and he stood still for some time. Suddenly the
Moon looked up and saw him watching her. Instantly she struck him with
her paddle, cutting off his head. Now the Sun was not near, but he knew
as soon as the Moon had cut off his son's head. And hurrying to the spot,
he put the boy's head back on, and he was alive again. Then the Sun said
to the Moon, "You cut off my son's head, and because you did this, ever
after on the earth people will cut off each other's heads.

The copper was still soft and pliable like clay, and the woman squatted on the ground with the heavy pot against her knees while she patted and shaped it. Now while she was working a son of Cal-chal, the Sun, came by and stopped to watch her mold the form.

The boy was greatly interested in seeing the jar grow larger, more beautiful, and smoother with each stroke, and he stood still for some time. Suddenly the Moon looked up and saw him watching her. Instantly she struck him with her paddle, cutting off his head. Now the Sun was not near, but he knew as soon as the Moon had cut off his son's head. And hurrying to the spot, he put the boy's head back on, and he was alive again.

                            13. Story # 1
One day the Moon, who was a woman named Kabigat, sat out in the
yard making a large copper pot. The copper was still soft and pliable like
clay, and the woman squatted on the ground with the heavy pot against
her knees while she patted and shaped it. Now while she was working a
son of Cal-chal, the Sun, came by and stopped to watch her mold the form.
Against the inside of the jar she pressed a stone, while on the outside with
a wooden paddle dripping with water she pounded and slapped until she
had worked down the bulges and formed a smooth surface. The boy was
greatly interested in seeing the jar grow larger, more beautiful, and
smoother with each stroke, and he stood still for some time. Suddenly the
Moon looked up and saw him watching her. Instantly she struck him with
her paddle, cutting off his head. Now the Sun was not near, but he knew
as soon as the Moon had cut off his son's head. And hurrying to the spot,
he put the boy's head back on, and he was alive again. Then the Sun said
to the Moon, "You cut off my son's head, and because you did this, ever
after on the earth people will cut off each other's heads.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The passage you provided is a traditional story or folklore from the Philippines. It tells the story of a woman named Kabigat, who is also the Moon, and a boy who is the son of Cal-chal, the Sun. The story describes how Kabigat, who is making a copper pot, strikes the boy with a wooden paddle, cutting off his head. The Sun comes and puts the boy's head back on, and he is alive again. The story ends with the Sun saying that because of Kabigat's actions, people on Earth will cut off each other's heads. It is not clear what the moral or lesson of the story is, or what its intended purpose is. However, it is an interesting and unique piece of cultural literature that offers a glimpse into the traditions and beliefs of the Philippines</p><br />
