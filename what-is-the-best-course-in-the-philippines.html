                    <p>An American scientist has worked out a program to improve the poultry stock in the Philippines by introducing a fine breed from the United States. At great expense, the exotic roosters are distributed to selected farmers in several barrios. The scientist then takes to the field to inspect the progress of the poultry improvement project. Having been informed of the coming visit of so important a personage, one farmer, in keeping with Filipino hospitality, makes preparations to welcome the VIP with the best he could offer. On his arrival at the farmer’s house, the American scientist is treated to a small feast-and on his dinner plate is the prize chicken, fried. The Filipino host feels only the best will suffice for his honored guest and, of course, the exotic bird is the best he has to offer.” What is your reaction here?​</p>

I want you prices, the masks, and the alcohol. We are also monitoring the hospital, and city health, these facilities are both ready if ever there is a need to take an action. Do not worry, we are together against this pandemic. My last call is that let’s trust and help one another. I would also like to call the attention of those who are not feeling well, do not be afraid to go to your nearest station, we got a lot of stations here where you can when the need requires it. We are just here if you are sick, do not worry, we are going to help you, together, and we will help each other for you to recover so that we could avoid infecting others.

                            1. An American scientist has worked out a program to improve the poultry stock in the Philippines by introducing a fine breed from the United States. At great expense, the exotic roosters are distributed to selected farmers in several barrios. The scientist then takes to the field to inspect the progress of the poultry improvement project. Having been informed of the coming visit of so important a personage, one farmer, in keeping with Filipino hospitality, makes preparations to welcome the VIP with the best he could offer. On his arrival at the farmer’s house, the American scientist is treated to a small feast-and on his dinner plate is the prize chicken, fried. The Filipino host feels only the best will suffice for his honored guest and, of course, the exotic bird is the best he has to offer.” What is your reaction here?​</h2><br />

                            2. The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) is a standardized test required to be admitted to many graduate schools in the United States.

According to the Educational Testing Service, the mean score for takers of GRE who do not have training courses is 555 with a standard deviation of 139. Brain Philippines (BP) offers expensive GRE training courses, claiming their graduates score better than those who have not taken any training courses. To test the company's claim, a statistician randomly selected 40 graduates of BP and asked their GRE scores and the random sample of 40 graduates he obtains recorded a mean score of 560 in GRE.

Second, there are many schools in the NCR that offer courses which are not available in schools in the province. Many students living in the provinces then decide to go to the region to get their education. Lastly, there are numerous places for leisure and entertainment in the cities in the NCR. People from the provinces are then encouraged to visit those places and to live there eventually. a. Migration is a major problem in NCRb.

Good Day to the people of OLONGAPO City, I know that we are all worried because of the corona virus or what we call COVID 19. I understand your anxiety but this is not the time to panic.

You can count on it that we will give you all the necessary information that we can get, we will give it to you because that is your privilege. I want to inform the people of OLONGAPO City, that based on the findings, definitely the spread of corona virus is not airborne, meaning to say when someone coughs, sneezes or if your hands are not clean, that is when the virus transfers, you need not worry if you’re inside a room with someone who has a possibility to have corona virus, it doesn’t mean to say that you might acquire the virus, In addition to this, face mask is essential, but it is more important to always wash your hands and observe proper hygiene , although of course, some of you would still want to use face mask, it is also good for you, it will give you peace of mind as well, those who would like to have face mask we are giving free mask in the city hall of OLONGAPO . I want you prices, the masks, and the alcohol. We are also monitoring the hospital, and city health, these facilities are both ready if ever there is a need to take an action. Do not worry, we are together against this pandemic. My last call is that let’s trust and help one another. I would also like to call the attention of those who are not feeling well, do not be afraid to go to your nearest station, we got a lot of stations here where you can when the need requires it. We are just here if you are sick, do not worry, we are going to help you, together, and we will help each other for you to recover so that we could avoid infecting others. Let us help and trust each other, I know we can overcome this pandemic, the Philippines and the whole world. God Bless OLONGAPO ! God Bless everyone! Everyone, please stay safe. THANK YOU!
