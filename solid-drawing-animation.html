                            18. II. Performance Task #2Directions: Express the following given fraction in decimal form.Trivia:The vast bulk water in Earth's atmosphere and crust comes from saline/salt water an average salinity of 35% equivalent to 34 grams of salts in every 1 kilogram of seawater. The remainder of Earth's water is fresh water. it is a marginal water uses by humans and animals. Land is a solid surface of Earth consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil and sometimes ice. Most of the human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas like agricultural, habitat, and various natural resources. Areas where land meets large body of water are called coastal zones.Use a circle and draw 2/3 body of water and 1/3 land surface. Do it on a short bond paper. ​</h2><br />
