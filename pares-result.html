On theright, a non-volatile solute has been dissolved into the solvent. Non-volatile means that the solute itself has little tendency to evaporate. Becausesome of the surface is now occupied by solute particles, there is less room forsolvent molecules. This results in less solvent being able to evaporate.Pare SolventSolutionFIGURE 7.

Then, explain in one to two paragraphs on how the selection depicts culture, history, and environment. Write your paragraph/s on a sheet of paper. The Untouchable Trees by Juan M. Flavier Pare Tonying is rather secretive about how he started his agricultural business, the results of which I can now observe and appreciate. But I was more interested in the real beginnings. It was unlikely that he had a great deal of money at the start. Consistent stories circulate about how Pare Tonying began in a small way. But somehow I suspect there was a small source of capital which sparked his ventures. "Did you inherit a lot from your parents, Pare Tonying?" I asked. "Alam ko namang di ka paparte kaya sasabihin ko sa iyo. (I know you will not share my inheritance so I will tell you the truth)," he answered. "I inherited five hectares of coconut plantation and the income partially sent me to school and started me in life." Pare Tonying said "partially" in referring to his education because he did not go far in school by choice and not for lack of money. I forgot all about this small coconut plantation until one day, Pare Tonying and I went to the other end of the province to visit a piece of land being offered for sale to him. It was a weekend. We both took the trip while away the time. On the way, we passed by Pare Tonying's coconut plantation. It is along the main dirt road, and one can easily judge that the coconut trees are​</a>

Write your answers on a separate sheetof paperMeiosisThe process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division in which the number ofchromosomes is reduced by half. It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms. During molosishomologous chromosomes separate, and the haploid cells that form have only one chromosome from eachpair Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two cell divisionsare called melosis and melosis ILPhases of MeiosisMeiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase. In both meiosis I and melosis 1. cels go through the samefour phases as mitosis. However, there are important differences between meiosis and mitosis.Melosis1. Prophase The nuclear envelope begins to break down and the chromosomes condense. Controlesstart moving to opposite poes of the cell, and a spindle begins to forres. Importantly, Momologouschromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase L. In prophase of mitosis and melonis il homologouschromosomes do not form pairs in this way.2. Metaphoset Spindle fibers attach to the paired homologous chromosomes. The pared chromosomesline up along the equator of the cel. This occus only in metaphase L in metaphase of mitosis andmelosis it, it is sister chromolids that line up along the equator of the cell.3. Anaphase E Spindle fibers shorten and the chromosomes of each homologous poir start to separate from eachother. One chromosome of each pair moves toward one pole of the cell and the other chromosome movestoward the opposite pole4. Telophase I and Cyioldnesis The spindle breaks down and new nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm ofthe cel divides, and two haploid daughter cells result, the daughter cells each have a random assortment ofchromosomes, with one from each homologous poir. Both daughter cells go on to meiosis II.Melosis 111. Prophase Ill. The nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle begins to form in each haplold daughter cellfrom melossi. The centro es also start to separate,2. Metaphase It Spindle fibers line up the sister chromatids of each chromosome along the equator of the cell3. Anaphose ft Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.4. Telophose II and Cytokinesis: The spindle breaks down, and new nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm ofeach cell divides, and four haploid cells resuit. Each cell has a unique combination of chromosomes.1. Define meiosis2 Is the DNA replicated after meiosis why or why nors3.

Write your paragraph/s on a sheet of paper. The Untouchable Trees by Juan M. Flavier Pare Tonying is rather secretive about how he started his agricultural business, the results of which I can now observe and appreciate. But I was more interested in the real beginnings. It was unlikely that he had a great deal of money at the start. Consistent stories circulate about how Pare Tonying began in a small way. But somehow I suspect there was a small source of capital which sparked his ventures. "Did you inherit a lot from your parents, Pare Tonying?" I asked. "Alam ko namang di ka paparte kaya sasabihin ko sa iyo. (I know you will not share my inheritance so I will tell you the truth)," he answered. "I inherited five hectares of coconut plantation and the income partially sent me to school and started me in life." Pare Tonying said "partially" in referring to his education because he did not go far in school by choice and not for lack of money. I forgot all about this small coconut plantation until one day, Pare Tonying and I went to the other end of the province to visit a piece of land being offered for sale to him. It was a weekend. We both took the trip while away the time. On the way, we passed by Pare Tonying's coconut plantation. It is along the main dirt road, and one can easily judge that the coconut trees are​</h2><br />
                        The Untouchable Tree is about our connection to the magnificence, the transcendence, and the essential nature of trees. Throughout human history, they have served as shelter and as symbol. And today, more than ever, our destiny is tied to theirs.<br />

Write your answers on a separate sheetof paperMeiosisThe process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division in which the number ofchromosomes is reduced by half. It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms. During molosishomologous chromosomes separate, and the haploid cells that form have only one chromosome from eachpair Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two cell divisionsare called melosis and melosis ILPhases of MeiosisMeiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase. In both meiosis I and melosis 1. cels go through the samefour phases as mitosis. However, there are important differences between meiosis and mitosis.Melosis1. Prophase The nuclear envelope begins to break down and the chromosomes condense. Controlesstart moving to opposite poes of the cell, and a spindle begins to forres. Importantly, Momologouschromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase L. In prophase of mitosis and melonis il homologouschromosomes do not form pairs in this way.2. Metaphoset Spindle fibers attach to the paired homologous chromosomes. The pared chromosomesline up along the equator of the cel. This occus only in metaphase L in metaphase of mitosis andmelosis it, it is sister chromolids that line up along the equator of the cell.3. Anaphase E Spindle fibers shorten and the chromosomes of each homologous poir start to separate from eachother. One chromosome of each pair moves toward one pole of the cell and the other chromosome movestoward the opposite pole4. Telophase I and Cyioldnesis The spindle breaks down and new nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm ofthe cel divides, and two haploid daughter cells result, the daughter cells each have a random assortment ofchromosomes, with one from each homologous poir. Both daughter cells go on to meiosis II.Melosis 111. Prophase Ill. The nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle begins to form in each haplold daughter cellfrom melossi. The centro es also start to separate,2. Metaphase It Spindle fibers line up the sister chromatids of each chromosome along the equator of the cell3. Anaphose ft Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.4. Telophose II and Cytokinesis: The spindle breaks down, and new nuclear membranes form.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A male with a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome is typically affected with the condition. Because females have two copies of the X chromosome and males have only one X chromosome, X-linked recessive diseases are more common among males than females. </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>REMINDER</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>Chromosome abnormalities can be numerical or structural.
