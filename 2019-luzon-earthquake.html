                        About the earthquake that happened in pampanga<p></p><p>On 22 April, at 5:15 p.m., a magnitude-6.1 earthquake occurred in northern Philippines, with the epicenter located near Castillejos, Zambales, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). The earthquake was tectonic in origin with a depth of 10 km.</p><p></p>What is an earthquake?<p></p><p>An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.</p><p></p>Why do some scientists says that earthquake had a good effect<p></p><p> Earthquakes are very useful to humans because they provide a picture of what’s going on underground. This can make oil and gas extraction more efficient, and allows scientists to monitor the progress of water during geothermal energy extraction.</p><p></p><p>They also tell you what is happening in the structure of the earth, for example, magma chambers, and allow scientists to monitor volcanoes and the threat of eruption.</p><p></p><p>Earthquakes can also tell us about the internal structure of the Earth. By measuring the time it takes the seismic waves to travel through the Earth we can map out the structure of the Earth down to the core.</p><p></p><p>On a global scale, earthquakes are just a symptom of the movements of the plates going on all the time, and they occur because the material at the surface at the earth is changing due to convection within the Earth’s mantle – mountains are being created, minerals from below are being brought up and new sea floors are being made.</p><p></p><p>Tectonic activity is essential to sustaining life on Earth. Matter is constantly being recycled between the atmosphere and the crust. We have continents because of tectonic activity. Mid ocean ridges support a huge amount of life, and may have been important in the origin of life, and the atmosphere is reliant on volcanic eruptions for it’s composition.</p><p></p>Hope it helps!<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First off all, the shaking of the ground is the most notable affect of the Earthquake. furthermore, ground rupture also occurs along with shaking. this results in serve damage to infrastructure facilities. the severity of the Earthquakes depends upon the magnitude and distance from the epicenter. also, the local geographical conditions  play a role in determining the severity. Ground rupture refers to the visible breaking of the Earth's surface.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>EARTHQUAKE'S EPICENTER<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Earthquake</strong> is the shaking of the outer layer of the Earth coming about because of an unexpected arrival of energy in the World's lithosphere that makes seismic waves. The seismicity, or seismic movement of <strong>earthquake</strong>, of a space is the recurrence, type, and size of quakes experienced throughout some undefined time frame. The word quake is likewise utilized for non-<strong>Earthquake </strong>seismic thundering.</p><p></p><p>At the World's surface, <strong>earthquake</strong>manifest themselves by shaking and uprooting or upsetting the ground. At the point when the focal point of a huge <strong>earthquake</strong> is found seaward, the seabed might be dislodged adequately to cause a tidal wave. <strong>Earthquake</strong> can likewise trigger avalanches and, sporadically, volcanic action.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Earthquake epicenter?​ :</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3897517</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
