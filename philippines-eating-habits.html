In a recent study by the University of the Philippines found out that young Filipinos are at a greater risk of NCDs, due to the consumption of food that is energy-dense and nutrient-poor, exacerbated by growing urbanization and increased income. The use of tobacco having unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity and obesity has reached the alarming levels. Nevertheless, there is still hope for everyone if people will work hand in hand towards achieving a healthy society. Hence, it can be said that fitness and health are, indeed, everyone's business. What do you think is implied by the phrase "fitness and health are everyone's business"?​</a>

In a recent study by the University of the Philippines found out that young Filipinos are at a greater risk of NCDs, due to the consumption of food that is energy-dense and nutrient-poor, exacerbated by growing urbanization and increased income. The use of tobacco having unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity and obesity has reached the alarming levels. Nevertheless, there is still hope for everyone if people will work hand in hand towards achieving a healthy society. Hence, it can be said that fitness and health are, indeed, everyone's business. What do you think is implied by the phrase "fitness and health are everyone's business"?​</h2><br />

Our health is also affected by our environment as to say that it's everyone's care and everyone has something to say about that matter.

In the Philippines, it is embedded in the culture that we love to eat. It is during mealtimes that we bond with our family, relatives, and friends. As a health advocate, your task is to create a one-day healthy meal plan for your family. Direction: Using the plates on the next page, create a meal plan for breakfast, lunch, and dinner that promotes healthy living by putting the name of the meal inside the plate. Then, fill up the table. Make sure to create three meal plans. Write your answers in your notebook or on a separate sheet of paper. Do not write anything on the module.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Wash hands before coming to the table.  Clean hands keep kids healthy!  Bottom line. Kids can understand that germs on their hands could get into their bodies if they use those dirty hands for eating. Make this easy for your kids by having a small step stool in the bathroom or by the kitchen sink.  This CAN become a habit!  I’ve seen kids as young as 2 years old washing their hands before a meal without their parents reminding them, because it was a habit!</p><p></p><p>2.Don’t talk with your mouth full.  This must be taught, as I know ADULTS who never learned it! If your bite of food is too big for your mouth to close, the bite was just too big!  No one wants to see the food in your mouth while you are eating.</p><p></p><p>3.Say please and thank you. Being polite is especially appropriate at the dinner table!  Saying please shows respect to those you are eating with, and saying thank you shows gratitude. Both of these behaviors are getting lost in society and teaching your kids while they are young will certainly pay off.</p><p></p><p>4.Wait to be excused until everyone is (at least mostly) finished eating. Dinner doesn’t have to be long! For fidgety kids, practice staying put for at least the first ten minutes of the meal.</p><p></p><p>5.Put napkin in your lap. I think it’s OK to make a game of this.  If you can sit through the meal without your napkin falling off your lap, than you’re a winner! Kids can use the napkin to wipe their hands or their mouths, but while they are young, it can indicate they were able to sit still at the table.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
