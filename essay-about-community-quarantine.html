                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Face-to-face learning is an instructional method where course content and learning material are taught in person to a group of students. This allows for a live interaction between a learner and an instructor. Learners benefit from a greater level of interaction with their fellow students as well. </p><p></p><p>The Advantages of Face to Face Learning in the Classroom is that you'll be able to concentrate harder on your learning because there'll be less distraction than if you were at home. You may feel more comfortable and learn more easily in a familiar, traditional classroom situation.</p><p></p><p>I believe that Face to Face learning is better than online learning because students have access to various learning resources on campus verses off. Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back. Is that really more conducive to a person’s education and learning?</p><p></p><p>Face to face students also gain from socialization with peers and interaction with teachers. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Brainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong> </strong><strong>please</strong></p><br />

And we can't do anything about it. Some are babbling, ranting into social media not understanding how our Government tried to this an effort for the country. </p>Body<p>My experience during the current CoViD-19 lockdown is sorrowful. I've been having a lot of things on my mind lately, i overthink about stuffs i shouldn't. I feel sad over everything. First, I feel unhappy because I'll just be staying at home(doesn't mean i disagree about the lockdown), i won't be able to socialize and have with friends and classmates at school, you know you'll realize school is fun when it's over, but very tiring when you're on it. I feel sad I can't go wherever I wanna be and hangout with some peers anytime I want to. On my home, it feels boring. You know it because the routine keeps back like a cycle. Do the house chores, cook, eat, sleep, surf on the internet, something like that. While worrying what worst could possibly happen? Everything is cancelled, even churches. So what we did with my family we just do evening and morning devotionals, church service at home when it's sabbath day, praying for everything to stop and make it normal. Hoping every minute, everyone is safe and is able to handle anything.</p>Conclusion<p>Therefore, I could say that this enhanced community quarantine is a <strong>good </strong>decision to make for all the people. Because it ensures the safety of the people, not just that it also makes our environment less polluted because our nature is now free from all the crowd finally can breath out  through itself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#AnswerForTrees #BrainlyLearnAtHome</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>FACE TO FACE CLASSES"</p><p></p><p>Face-to-face learning is an instructional method where course content and learning material are taught in person to a group of students. This allows for a live interaction between a learner and an instructor. Learners benefit from a greater level of interaction with their fellow students as well.</p><p></p><p>Face to Face Classes enables you to concentrate harder on your learning because there'll be less distraction than if you were at home. You may feel more comfortable and learn more easily in a familiar, traditional classroom situation.</p><p></p><p>I believe that Face to Face learning is better than online learning because students have access to various learning resources on campus verses off. Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back. Is that really more conducive to a person’s education and learning?</p><p></p><p>Face to face students also gain from socialization with peers and interaction with teachers. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong></strong></p><p>The current state of affairs put the world on pause, but this pause gave me time to reflect on troubling matters. Time that so many others like me probably also desperately needed to heal without even knowing it. Sometimes it takes one’s world falling apart for the most beautiful mosaic to be built up from the broken pieces of wreckage.  </p><p>
</p><p>As the school year was coming to a close and summer was edging around the corner, I began reflecting on how people will spend their summer breaks if the country remains in its current state throughout the sunny season. Aside from living in the sunny beach state of California where people love their vitamin D and social festivities, I think some of the most damaging effects will have on us all has more to do with social distancing policies than with any inconveniences we now face due to the added precautions, despite how devastating it may feel that Disneyland is closed to all the local annual or that the beaches may not be filled with sun-kissed California girls this summer. During this unprecedented time, I don’t think we should allow the rare opportunity we now have to be able to watch in real time how the effects of social distancing can impact our mental health. Before the pandemic, many of us were already engaging in a form of social distancing. Perhaps not the exact same way we are now practicing, but the technology that we have developed over recent years has led to a dramatic decline in our social contact and skills in general.  </p><p>
</p><p>The debate over whether we should remain quarantined during this time is not an argument I am trying to pursue. Instead, I am trying to encourage us to view this event as a unique time to study how social distancing can affect people’s mental health over a long period of time and with dramatic results due to the magnitude of the current issue. Although  is new and unfamiliar to everyone, the isolation and separation we now face is not. For many, this type of behavior has already been a lifestyle choice for a long time. However, the current situation we all now face has allowed us to gain a more personal insight on how that experience feels due to the current circumstances. Mental illness continues to remain a prevalent problem throughout the world and for that reason could be considered a pandemic of a sort in and of itself long before the outbreak.  </p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being a student in times of Covid-19</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Being a student is already difficult in normal times... Most of us attempt to juggle studying, earning a livelihood, gaining early job experience (e.g. internships), and attending one or more student parties (obviously for networking). Being a student amid a worldwide epidemic is terrifying, to say the least.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that living and studying in Germany is already something many (young) people want to, and Germany definitely handled Covid-19 admirably, so every issue detailed below may be interpreted as moaning about first-world difficulties. Nonetheless, Germany's universities, or more broadly, its educational system, are not widely renowned for being leaders in digitalized learning. Some institutes are faring better than others, either because they previously placed a greater emphasis on offering digitalized learning and testing services, or because they swiftly adapted to it.</p><p>Without a doubt, no one could have predicted a worldwide catastrophe, and it is always simpler to point out what could have been done better in retrospect than it is during times of uncertainty and the urgent need to act. So, rather than throwing accusations and blame about, which is a) pointless and b) something I am not in a position to do anyhow, let's focus on what can be done to alleviate some circumstances. Moving to digitalized educational offers has many advantages, but the quick changes necessitated by Covid-19 have also resulted in certain difficulties that could have been avoided with more time and a more stable economic and social context.As a result, I'd want to look at some issues that have arisen for students in recent months and provide some examples of how to cope with them.</p><br />

                            30. Compose a short argumentative essay regarding on your stand about the presence of military power on the enforcement of the community quarantine on our communities. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As the effects of COVID-19 are increasingly felt around the United States, many officials and commentators have asked what role the U.S. military might play as part of the response. Several state governors have already called up elements of the National Guard as part of their emergency measures. This analysis addresses the distinctive roles of U.S. federal military forces and state National Guard units, the ways U.S. forces could be most helpful, the limitations on military forces, and the potential cost of employing the military to help fight the coronavirus.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>When troops are used domestically, the matter of “authorities” becomes paramount. The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878 in response to reconstruction of the South, forbade federal troops from participating in law enforcement. As a result, the federal government has been very reluctant to use active-duty troops in situations where they may interact with citizens. Federal troops can be used domestically under the Insurrection Act of 1807 to suppress lawlessness, insurrection, and rebellion and have been so used in rare situations, for example the Los Angeles riots of 1992. That authority is intentionally narrow and would not seem to allow federal troops to be used in a humanitarian situation like suppressing a pandemic. However, lawyers can be quite imaginative in finding ways to stretch statutory text.
</p><p>
</p><p>The National Guard, being the successor to the state militias, is not restricted by Posse Comitatus and can, in theory, enforce the law (as can the Coast Guard). Thus, it is the National Guard that is used most commonly in extremis to suppress riots. It could, in theory, enforce quarantines on communities.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, states are reluctant to use the National Guard in this way because soldiers make bad police officers. Soldiers are heavily armed and taught to regard the population as “threats.” Police officers are lightly armed and trained to protect the citizenry. Using soldiers for law enforcement entails the risk of abuse and misunderstanding. Post-Katrina New Orleans provided a good example of this when General Honore barked at troops to put down their guns. Thus, the National Guard troops on the Southwest border could, in theory, apprehend illegal immigrants but don’t. That is left to the Border Patrol, whose officers have the necessary training.
</p><p>
</p><p>Instead, the National Guard and federal troops have typically provided support to humanitarian assistance and law enforcement organizations rather than interact directly with the citizenry.</p><p></p><p>I made this so you can also learn something new :) </p><br />
