                                            1. Barry liked playing board games, but he hated losing. He hated losing so much that he would do whatever it took to win, even bending or breaking the rules. He'd steal money from the bank and hide it under the couch cushions. He'd skip spaces while he was moving around the board. He'd shortchange others money that they were owed and argue with them about it. Barry's techniques were effective. He did win most of the games that he played, but the people whom he played with were his friends and family, and it didn't take too long until they caught on to Barry's tricks. They tried to tell Barry to stop cheating. They said that the game wasn't any fun when he cheated, but he didn't listen. He continued with his treacherous style of gameplay, until nobody would play with him anymore. Barry may have won a lot of games, but at what cost?1.What is the theme of the story? 2.What happens in the story that leads you to believe this?pls answer​</a>

At first she never thought of complaining as her salary rate is quite low for a professional like her who graduated at the top of her class in a state university. However five months have passed until she felt that her efforts are not being compensated well enough. She started questioning the unfair practices, the alleged abuse and the lack of benefits provided by the company. Everything is crashing down on her thoughts until she began questioning life and the difficulties she is experiencing. Point to Ponder Do you think that there is indeed a reason for Kim to feel and perceive that she is being shortchanged in her work? What values are reflected in her behavior and responses?edure as stated below.​</a>

                                            Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú has some words of advice for political leaders. Slim, who built a $69 billion fortune over nearly five decades, is concerned about the world in general. He says governments should stop trying to shrink budget deficits by shortchanging education. Since 2004, Carlos Slim has stepped down from the boards of three of his largest companies. He wants nothing more than to tell me how he would solve the challenges facing Europe, the U.S. and Mexico. Slim likes to talk and likes to revisit his roots. His biggest success was the $1.76 billion privatization of Telmex, now part of America Móvil. Privatization is Slim's first suggestion for struggling European economies. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim calls for better regulation of the banking system in the U.S. Unemployment must also be addressed, he says. Invest in labor-intensive industries such as tourism, health care, education and entertainment, he advises. We don't look for size. We look for quality, Slim says. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has put his sons in charge of his companies. His son-in-law Arturo Elías Ayub serves as one of Slim's right- hand men. Minera Frisco's market capitalization has soared to $11.7 billion, 25% greater than its former parent Grupo Carso. The company will invest around $9 billion annually over the next four years to expand its operations in Latin America. Critics in Mexico blame him for excessive prices, but he says his customers are not fools. He points to a report showing wireless revenues at 4 cents per minute in Mexico, nearly as low as the U.S. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's net worth has risen from $1.7 billion in 1991 to $10.8 billion today. He first appeared on FORBES Billionaires list in 1991, based primarily on his Grupo Carso stake. By the time Telmex split into América Móvil in 2001, his fortune had grown to nearly $10 billion. Mexican telecom magnate Carlos Slim founded América Móvil in 1994. The company's share price grew sixfold between 2004 and 2008. Slim held the title of world's richest man in 2010, 2011 and this year. His fortune is primarily comprised of shares he and his family own in public companies. He has put $4 billion into two foundations and a system of digital libraries. Slim's aim is to ensure 60% of Latin America has access to computers by 2015, the same timeline as UN's Millennium Development Goals. The Carlos Slim Health Institute has spent about $20 million since 2001 on organ transplants. The family has funded 7,100 transplants in the past decade. He opened a huge new museum in March last year, the Museo Soumaya. It showcases some 3,400 of the 64,000 pieces of art Slim has collected.               Critique/Reaction ,,,, plss Po ☺️​</a>

                            1. How will you deal a customer, a negativist, criticizes your pasta sayingit doesn't deserve its price. He feels shortchanged.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The first step in receiving criticism is to listen actively and make a concerted effort not to be defensive. Remember that giving criticism can be almost as hard as receiving it, so neither you nor your critic are likely to be entirely comfortable. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> For me, I will accept his criticism. Explain. Ask for suggested solutions. After that, if both of you agreed with your convo about solutions then transact and satisfy him the next time he'll buy your product.  </p><br />
