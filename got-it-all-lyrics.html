Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me

                                            What I Have LearnedACTIVITY 8:HYDirection: Write TRUE if the statement is correct. Write FALSE if the statement isincorrect. Copy and write answer on your activity notebook.1. When you are singing on stage, you're not only combining languageand music, you've also got to deal with spatial awareness and beaware of the people around you.2. To get the right sense of spontaneity to your performance, it's okay toforget and not perform at all.3. Forgetting the lyrics is okay. It's okay to ruin the performance.4. Stage fright only happens to beginners5. Your route into a character or song can come from many differentsources, there's no one right way. You sing when speech isn't enough,and on stage we have to believe that there's a need, at a certainmoment, to sing.6. Stress is often relieved by physical exercise, so stretch and run on thespot before you perform. If you suffer from a dry throat, which is aclassic symptom of nerves, try gently biting your tongue to increaseyour saliva flow.7. Stage fright is usually triggered by something we are able to control,but it can sometimes take a trained expert to identify what might havecaused our uncertainty.​</a>

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal
Watercourses, underground pools,
Virgin forest, and powdery
White sands.
This is Bohol

Read the following lines taken from the song “Magellan” (sung by Yoyoy Villame). 
Then answer the questions that follow.
Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember The people we used to be It's even harder to picture That you're not here next to me You say it's too late to make it But is it too late to try? And in our time that you wasted All of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time, when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone, trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow 'Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But you just gave it away You can't expect me to be fine I don't expect you to care I know I've said it before But all of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time When we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone Man, f that s I'll be out spending all this money While you sitting 'round wondering Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing Made it from the bottom Now, when you see me I'm stunning And all of my cars start with a push of a button Telling me had chances I blew up Or whatever you call it Switch the number to my phone So you never could call it Don't need my name on my show You can tell that I'm balling Swish, what a shame could have got picked Had a really good game But you missed your last shot So you talk about who you see at the top Or what you could have saw But sad to say it's over for Phantom pulled up valet open doors Wished I'd go away Got what you was looking for Now it's me who they want So you can go and take that Little piece of s with you I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All these fairy tales are full of s Yeah, one more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone ​</a>

                                            MUSIC: Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if it is wrong. Use the blank space provided before the number for your answers. 1. When you are singing on stage, you're not only combining language and music, you've also got to deal with spatial awareness and be aware of the people around you.2. To get the right sense of spontaneity to your performance, it's okay to forget and not perform at all. 3. Forgetting the lyrics is okay. It's okay to ruin the performance. 4. Stage tright only happens to beginners 5. Your route into a character or song can come from many different sources, there's no one night way. You sing when speech isn't enough, and on stage we have to believe that there's a need, at a certain moment, to sing.​</a>

Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</a>

                                            (guess the lyrics po kong alam po nyo yong answer) good luck
Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these
I ain't gonna hide these
Hide these
Hide these beautiful scars
No

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Copy and write answer on your activity notebook.1. When you are singing on stage, you're not only combining languageand music, you've also got to deal with spatial awareness and beaware of the people around you.2. To get the right sense of spontaneity to your performance, it's okay toforget and not perform at all.3. Forgetting the lyrics is okay. It's okay to ruin the performance.4. Stage fright only happens to beginners5. Your route into a character or song can come from many differentsources, there's no one right way. You sing when speech isn't enough,and on stage we have to believe that there's a need, at a certainmoment, to sing.6. Stress is often relieved by physical exercise, so stretch and run on thespot before you perform. If you suffer from a dry throat, which is aclassic symptom of nerves, try gently biting your tongue to increaseyour saliva flow.7. Stage fright is usually triggered by something we are able to control,but it can sometimes take a trained expert to identify what might havecaused our uncertainty.​</h2><br />

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal

Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember The people we used to be It's even harder to picture That you're not here next to me You say it's too late to make it But is it too late to try? And in our time that you wasted All of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time, when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone, trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow 'Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But you just gave it away You can't expect me to be fine I don't expect you to care I know I've said it before But all of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time When we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two?

Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All these fairy tales are full of s Yeah, one more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone ​</h2><br />

                            10. MUSIC: Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if it is wrong. Use the blank space provided before the number for your answers. 1. When you are singing on stage, you're not only combining language and music, you've also got to deal with spatial awareness and be aware of the people around you.2. To get the right sense of spontaneity to your performance, it's okay to forget and not perform at all. 3. Forgetting the lyrics is okay. It's okay to ruin the performance. 4. Stage tright only happens to beginners 5. Your route into a character or song can come from many different sources, there's no one night way. You sing when speech isn't enough, and on stage we have to believe that there's a need, at a certain moment, to sing.​</h2><br />

WEEK 1 - MAKING CONNECTIONS (Compare and contrast similar information presented in different texts) Read the following poem and song lyrics and analyze them by doing annotations. Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</h2><br />

Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these
I ain't gonna hide these
Hide these
Hide these beautiful scars

                        <p>a.While spending time outside is the best way to get vitamin D, it is also important to protect your skin from burning. Additionally, taking in more sunlight also leads to an increase in serotonin levels. Serotonin is a chemical in the brain that has been shown to be directly linked to mood,And Daylighting has been associated with improved mood, enhanced morale, less fatigue, and reduced eyestrain (Robbins, 1986). Many studies show that the performance and productivity of workers in office, industrial, and retail environments can increase with the quality of light.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope it helps</p><p>Mark me Brainliest</p><p>(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ</p><br />
