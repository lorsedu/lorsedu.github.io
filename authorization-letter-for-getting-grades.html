                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</a>

                                            Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

                            3. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />

                            6. Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.
