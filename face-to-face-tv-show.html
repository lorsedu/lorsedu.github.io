B. <strong>In his talk, the congressman made mention of providing road to market in most of the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>barrios.</strong></p><p></p>Understanding facts and opinions<p>  1. <strong>Recognizing Facts</strong></p><p>  Understanding facts in sentences is to be a trait that shows the form of sentences based on real situations or events, problems, and the context of discourse that actually happened. Truth, in fact, creates characteristics or characteristics in the sentence so that it can display the truth itself linguistically. It is said to be a fact if it is displayed because it has been tested and proven.</p><p>  <strong>Sentences</strong> of fact can then be interpreted as an arrangement of language that displays real phenomena or actually occurs without a mixture of opinions or the author's perspective about the events or phenomena being discussed in the context of the sentence. So it can be concluded that the fact sentence can be identified if there is no opinion sentence in the context of the sentence.</p><p>  <strong>Sentences of fact</strong> in the context of written communication will be found in many informative news texts. As in print media such as newspapers, magazines, bulletins, brochures, and so on, and online or online media such as online news on websites or videos and picture illustrations. In practice, news is objective and factual, so it must contain sentences that describe actual events that aim to provide information to many people. That is why we should only believe the truth or facts in the news so as not to be consumed by false information.</p><p></p><p>  2. <strong>Opinion Definition</strong></p><p>  Opinion is a form of thought, or a person's stance when dealing with certain phenomena based on their perspective. That is why an opinion depends on who expresses it. It is not a factual event that occurs, but a response to the occurrence of that incident. s a result, it is natural that there will be many different opinions on a single phenomenon depending on the perspective of each individual.</p><p>  In practice, <strong>opinions</strong> usually include facts and data to strengthen someone's argument or opinion. Conveying a certain opinion usually requires certain facts so that the opinion is stronger and can convince someone. hat is why opinions cannot be separated from facts, because if opinions arise without being balanced by facts, their income will be weak compared to the involvement of facts and data in presenting opinions.</p><p>  So, <strong>opinion</strong> is a person's response, statement, mindset, and knowledge of the phenomena that occur that require facts to strengthen the opinion. In contrast to facts, opinions have a purpose and function in linguistic phenomena, namely to show many perspectives on certain phenomena in order to have many discussions.</p><p></p><p>  Learn related information at https://brainly.co.id/tugas/5473197.</p><p></p><p>  #SPJ6</p><br />

There are increasing indications that the world will look different after the crisis and that globalization will be questioned in many areas. According to these observations, the COVID-19 crisis would mark a turning point. In times of deep uncertainty, science is asked to look to the future and to flank a rational discourse about how to react to the current global crisis, and therefore now better cope with other tantamount global challenges such as the climate change.</p><p> </p><p>sana po makatulong</p><p></p><br />
