                        1.) when the story is very interesting and you know that the reader is having fun or smiling while reading the book, that's when you know its a good book. <br /><br />2.) Watching movies. Everyone is different of course but i prefer watching movies because you can see the actors act base on the story line, not like reading you have to imagine/picture what's going on with the book story line<br /><br />3.) It's kind of a slang word that everyone often use nowadays, no it doesn't mean that you're really gonna run away from something or someone, it means you want to have a relaxing time for the moment, to get you out from that stressful thing you're doing<br /><br />4.)

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I felt very proud of myself because in my opinion, I think that I have made something worth of praising myself. I felt a sense of achievement that I haven't always had and that makes it more of something I can be happy of. It might be little to you but it's best to appreciate the little things since it makes life at least a little bit more colorful.</p><p>2. Shoes don't last for long since our foot size changes as we grow older. A phone in the otherhand can be used in different ways and can last until we reach the age of working amd independence. I have to prioritize what I can make use of and since my education is involved, I have to choose that side because our system needs education and something we can poudly write on our resumé in the far future.</p><p>3. I will use them in a way that would benefit me and others. I'll choose the paths that would lead me to the destination where I can live the way I want to with no regrets.</p><br />

What is in these stories that you like? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. A good book has a unique plot, well-made characters and gives us the feels. Characteristics of a good book is the emotions that the writer wants to reach us, the writer wanted us to feel what he/she feels, we wanted to relate, to connect in the story, and to feel that happiness.</p><p></p><p>2. For me, I prefer reading books. Because in books it has a unique way of creating the story and the caracters has a well-developed attitude. And when I read books, I feel like I'm being connected to it or attached to it, I feel like I am inside the story and I am the main character in it.</p><p></p><p>3. Escape means that you want to find something that is different from the reality, just like reading books. You read books to escape reality, you wanted to be inside the story because in books everything is possible whether you fall in love with a gangster or surviving a plane crash and so on. No, the girls are not running away. It simply means that we wanted to escape from the hard things we endured or overcome, it means that we just wanted to chill and escape from our problems.</p><p></p><p>4. Liza. Because just like Liza said she wanted to escape, and so reading books is her escape.</p><p></p><p>5. There is a lot actually, but I'll just give two. These are If I fall and I'm inlove with a gamer. In If I fall, the stories tells us that even if you are different, there will always be a person who will love you, who will completely accept you. (Spoiler!) And in the end the girl doesn't choose anyone from the both guys who loves her because she wanted to make decisions for herself and she is thankful that someone likes her for who she is and what she is. In I'm inlove with a gamer, what I realized in here is that even if you are completely different or not nice, there will always be a person who will change you and will accept you. And even if there are many problems they have encountered, they never give up. They will fight for their love and fight for who they love.</p><br />
