Setting SpotlightH. Recommendations1.The film was keen on details and it's refreshing. This film deserves to be watched toinspire each and every one of us. If you allow it the film can even move your heart.If you liked Kita Kita, then l' assure you that you'rdig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as welland get the "I want to watch it againl"feeling.2.Loser to ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters' journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel showswriting poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed atbecause of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and thatsame inspiration is not enough to win a gid or to have a happy ending. Santos'sperformance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreakingconfrontation scene: 'Friendzoned' right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella,who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She's effortless even if she is playing afrustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in rollercoaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hafing her, but I realized she'san epitome of a character we need to embracel3."100 Tula Para kay Stella" is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about afreshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to expresshis love for the campus rock star, Stella, When in college, they become close friends.When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confesshis love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that tumed into "love", but it's not atypical love story that we've seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90's FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there's the element of nostalgia in the film, resonatingwith the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of thevintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98' Degreesand Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya's "Balisong", it displays the time when Pinoy RockBands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting atthe same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the "I want to watch this!" feeling. At first, when I heard it frommy classmates. I thought it would be about 'spoken poetry' which has been in socialmedia platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino(PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh andnew to movie audiences. 100 Tula Para kay Stella' gives the idea that mainstreamand indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardlypresent in mainstream cinema.I love that there's more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirablecharacters and the 2000's vibes.​</a>

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong.

If you allow it the film can even move your heart.If you liked Kita Kita, then l' assure you that you'rdig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as welland get the "I want to watch it againl"feeling.2.Loser to ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters' journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel showswriting poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed atbecause of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and thatsame inspiration is not enough to win a gid or to have a happy ending. Santos'sperformance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreakingconfrontation scene: 'Friendzoned' right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella,who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She's effortless even if she is playing afrustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in rollercoaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hafing her, but I realized she'san epitome of a character we need to embracel3."100 Tula Para kay Stella" is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about afreshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to expresshis love for the campus rock star, Stella, When in college, they become close friends.When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confesshis love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that tumed into "love", but it's not atypical love story that we've seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90's FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there's the element of nostalgia in the film, resonatingwith the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of thevintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98' Degreesand Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya's "Balisong", it displays the time when Pinoy RockBands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting atthe same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the "I want to watch this!" feeling. At first, when I heard it frommy classmates. I thought it would be about 'spoken poetry' which has been in socialmedia platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino(PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh andnew to movie audiences. 100 Tula Para kay Stella' gives the idea that mainstreamand indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardlypresent in mainstream cinema.I love that there's more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirablecharacters and the 2000's vibes.​</h2><br />
