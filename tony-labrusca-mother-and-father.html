                        Just my opinion Tony's age is 8 and Teddy's age is 6 it said that thrice of their mother's age so if you add the age of tony and teddy that answer is 14 so you will times it to three because thrice their mother's age the answer is 42 so the age of <br />Tony is 8 and the age of Teddy is 6.<br /><br />Hope it's correct and it helps!!<br />

b. How can the present family condition of Tony affects his physical health? Please explain your
answer.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>It can not only effect Tony's physical health but as well as the entire family</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Because it their father can't get the amount of money that is enough for all the things they need, they will continue buying food that are usually cheaper than the food they usually buy and the food that are cheap are not usually that healthy. If that continues the family will eventually get sick because of their lack of nutrients in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps. Continue studying hard. And have a great Day! </p><p></p><br />
