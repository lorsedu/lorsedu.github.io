                                            THE INVENTION OF FOODS 
 have you wondered where all those new foods on the supemarket shelf come from? hundreds of new foods are invented every year, and each one is the result of an invetor at work. potato chips, chewing gum, and peanut butter are three popular foods that were invented here in North America
 Today, potato chips are the biggest selling snack food in canada. The averacanadian eats about4.5 kg of potato chips every year. Sometimes inventions happen by accident. this is how the potato chip was invented about 10 yrs old by a chef named George Crumb. One night a customer at the restaurant asked George to make the potatoes thinner and George cut them as thin as paper and fried them in oil. The costumer loved them and the idea soon caught on, but it wasn't until a potato peeling machine was invented that potato chips could be made in factories and sold all over North America. 
 Imagine a chewing gum made from tree sap. The ealiest chewing gum was invented by the Aboriginal peoples, who used the black spruce tree for a kind of chewy snack, The Aboriginal peoples shared this idea with the pioneers who settled in North America In 1850, John Curtis decided to turn this idea into a chewing gum business. He cooked the gum until it was thick, roolled it out, and cut it into small pieces. they called it "pure spruce gum" It wasn't until 1906 that the first gum as invented. it was called "blibber- blubber". Today there are over a hundred different kinds of bubble gum and new flavours are always being invented. 
 It's hard to believe that four out four out of every five homes in canada has peanut butter in the cupboard. peanut butter was invented by a doctor From St. Louis, U.S.A. in 1890. he wanted to give his patients a high- protein food that was easy to digest. there are eight grams of protein in two tablespoons of peanut butter and also contains some vitamins and minerals. Now there are lots of factories that make peanut butter and this sticky food is the most common sandwich filling in children's lunches. what kind is your favourite, smooth or chunky?
 Our food is always changing thanks to inventors who continue to think up new foods, So go ahead, crunch that potato chips, chews that gum, and spread the peanut butter! Perhaps someday you will create a food of your own.

Advances in packaging materials have played an important role in modern food preservation.Preservation allows people to ship foods over greater distances, stock them in stores longer, and enjoy them for a greater part of the year with more nutrients intact. Processing can also help to inhibit or destroy pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that may contaminate food.<br />

                            7. THE INVENTION OF FOODS 
 have you wondered where all those new foods on the supemarket shelf come from? hundreds of new foods are invented every year, and each one is the result of an invetor at work. potato chips, chewing gum, and peanut butter are three popular foods that were invented here in North America
 Today, potato chips are the biggest selling snack food in canada. The averacanadian eats about4.5 kg of potato chips every year. Sometimes inventions happen by accident. this is how the potato chip was invented about 10 yrs old by a chef named George Crumb. One night a customer at the restaurant asked George to make the potatoes thinner and George cut them as thin as paper and fried them in oil. The costumer loved them and the idea soon caught on, but it wasn't until a potato peeling machine was invented that potato chips could be made in factories and sold all over North America. 
 Imagine a chewing gum made from tree sap. The ealiest chewing gum was invented by the Aboriginal peoples, who used the black spruce tree for a kind of chewy snack, The Aboriginal peoples shared this idea with the pioneers who settled in North America In 1850, John Curtis decided to turn this idea into a chewing gum business. He cooked the gum until it was thick, roolled it out, and cut it into small pieces. they called it "pure spruce gum" It wasn't until 1906 that the first gum as invented. it was called "blibber- blubber". Today there are over a hundred different kinds of bubble gum and new flavours are always being invented. 
 It's hard to believe that four out four out of every five homes in canada has peanut butter in the cupboard. peanut butter was invented by a doctor From St. Louis, U.S.A. in 1890. he wanted to give his patients a high- protein food that was easy to digest. there are eight grams of protein in two tablespoons of peanut butter and also contains some vitamins and minerals. Now there are lots of factories that make peanut butter and this sticky food is the most common sandwich filling in children's lunches. what kind is your favourite, smooth or chunky?
 Our food is always changing thanks to inventors who continue to think up new foods, So go ahead, crunch that potato chips, chews that gum, and spread the peanut butter! Perhaps someday you will create a food of your own.
