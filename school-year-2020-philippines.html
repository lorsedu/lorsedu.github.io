Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Philippine COVID-19 Response
<p>
</p><p>It was December 31, 2019. People all over the world are optimistic about the year 2020 because it brings in a new decade. However, in Wuhan, China, dozens of people are mysteriously dying from pneumonia.
</p><p>
Three months later, the whole world is on a lockdown, and the number of infected kept on rising. The World Health Organization decided to name this new disease as <strong>COVID-19</strong>, and the virus that causes it as SARS-COV-2. During the first phase of the pandemic, the Philippines had to close its doors from the outside world. Towns, cities, and provinces also closed their borders. People stockpiled because they do not know how long the lockdown will last.
</p><p>
There were multiple surges in 2020, and it carried over to 2021. Tens of thousands have died, and then, a miracle came in the form of vaccines. At first, there were only a few thousand people who are being vaccinated, but as the government became aggressive on their vaccination program, tens of millions of Filipinos have been inoculated. Today, the cases are dropping, and the Philippines is slowly reopening, thanks to the effort of the government, the medical professionals, and everyone who made it possible.

The international and domestic markets particularly our country was affected for more than a year resulted to economic recession since the unemployment rate of the country rose to 17.7% and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) registered -9.5% for 2020 according to Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA, 2021). As a senior high school student, how would you apply the concepts of monetary and fiscal policies to address the economics problem of the Philippines today.​</h2><br />
                        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant economic challenges not only in the Philippines but also across the world. As a senior high school student, it is essential to understand the concepts of monetary and fiscal policies and how they can help address the economic problems faced by the country today.</p><p></p><p>Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by the central bank of a country to control the money supply and achieve certain economic goals. One way to address the economic problems in the Philippines today is by implementing expansionary monetary policy. This involves increasing the money supply and reducing interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending. By lowering interest rates, businesses and individuals are more likely to invest and spend, which can stimulate economic growth. The central bank can also increase the money supply by purchasing government bonds or other financial assets, which can inject more money into the economy. However, there is a risk of inflation with this policy, which can reduce the value of the currency and increase the cost of living.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, fiscal policy refers to the government's use of spending and taxation to influence the economy. One way to address the economic problems in the Philippines is through expansionary fiscal policy. This involves increasing government spending and reducing taxes to stimulate economic activity. By increasing government spending, the government can invest in infrastructure projects, healthcare, and education, which can create job opportunities and increase demand for goods and services. The reduction of taxes can also increase disposable income, which can encourage spending and stimulate economic growth. However, there is a risk of budget deficits with this policy, which can lead to an increase in government debt.</p><p></p><p>In addressing the economic problems of the Philippines today, it is important to strike a balance between monetary and fiscal policies. A combination of both expansionary monetary and fiscal policies may be necessary to stimulate the economy and create job opportunities. For instance, the central bank can implement expansionary monetary policies to reduce interest rates and increase the money supply, while the government can implement expansionary fiscal policies by increasing government spending on infrastructure, healthcare, and education.</p><p></p><p>However, it is important to note that implementing expansionary monetary and fiscal policies may have limitations. For instance, during the pandemic, businesses may be hesitant to invest or borrow due to uncertainty in the economy, and individuals may not be spending as much as they used to. Thus, it is important to also address the root cause of the economic problems, such as containing the spread of the virus and ensuring the safety of the population.</p><p></p><p>Overall, by implementing a combination of both short-term and long-term strategies, the country can work towards a sustainable and resilient economy despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. As a senior high school student, it is crucial to stay informed and engaged in understanding the economic issues and contribute to finding solutions to help the country's economic recovery.</p><p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />

                        <p>Common Diseases During the Rainy Season</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rainy Season, or the wet season, is one among the four seasons when the region is average rainfall is achieved. It is generally caused due to changes in the flow of winds and other geological factors. Generally, the rainy season brings much-needed relief from the extreme heat of the preceding summer season, replenishing the rivers and lakes. Plants that were previously wilted spring to life in the rainy season. </p><p></p><p>Animals are also active during the rainy season. This is the season where farmers look forward to, as rain becomes the saving grace for their crops. However, the season also has the potential to bring about large scale destruction if preventive measures are not taken. Floods, hurricanes, storms and other water-related natural calamities usually occur during the rainy season. </p><p></p><p>Historically, people have always associated the rainy season with the growth of vegetation. However, from an agricultural perspective, food crops do not reach their full maturity and it can cause food shortages in some parts of the world. </p><p></p><p>During this season, an increase in the incidence of malaria and other water-borne diseases are also observed. The sudden onset of monsoon can also make people prone to other diseases such as jaundice, typhoid, and cholera. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

It is generally caused due to changes in the flow of winds and other geological factors. Generally, the rainy season brings much-needed relief from the extreme heat of the preceding summer season, replenishing the rivers and lakes. Plants that were previously wilted spring to life in the rainy season.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Animals are also active during the rainy season. This is the season where farmers look forward to, as rain becomes the saving grace for their crops. However, the season also has the potential to bring about large scale destruction if preventive measures are not taken. Floods, hurricanes, storms and other water-related natural calamities usually occur during the rainy season.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Historically, people have always associated the rainy season with the growth of vegetation. However, from an agricultural perspective, food crops do not reach their full maturity and it can cause food shortages in some parts of the world.</p><p></p><p></p><p>During this season, an increase in the incidence of malaria and other water-borne diseases are also observed.

When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your workload can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.

It is generally caused due to changes in the flow of winds and other geological factors. Generally, the rainy season brings much-needed relief from the extreme heat of the preceding summer season, replenishing the rivers and lakes.

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

Reshaping schooling perspectives and practices should deliberate on the why, who, what and how of education.
