AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                                            AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1.

 Circle the letter of the correct answer.
AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                            14. AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1.
