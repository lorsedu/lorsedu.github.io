                                            8 A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

One day the farmer said, “I can get more from my farm if my carabao works all day and my cow works all night." This went on for a month 'til finally, the carabao cried, "It is just too hot to work all day!" "Want to go for a swim?” asked the cow. "It will cool you off.” The carabao happily agreed. They went off without the farmer's consent. Before swimming, they hung their skins on a tree branch. But it wasn't long till the farmer went looking for them. Upon seeing the farmer, they rushed to put on their skins. In their rush, the carabao had worn the cow's skin and the cow had worn the carabao's skin.

(An excerpt) Japanese believe that Filipinos are extremely hard-working. This is very easy to see, considering the wide variety of industries Filipinos work in and the number of hours they put in each day. You can see Filipinos working in healthcare, hospitality, electronics, food services, teaching, and construction among other industries. In fact, 100,000 Filipino workers might come to Japan as it looks to hire many foreign nationals. As a result, Filipinos have earned a high regard, continuing to enjoy a great reputation among Japanese. Moreover, they consider Filipinos good at speaking English. This is one of the reasons many Japanese tend to go to the Philippines to study English. Considering a flight between Tokyo and Manila lasts less than five​</a>

Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

                                            A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

This went on for a month 'til finally, the carabao cried, "It is just too hot to work all day!" "Want to go for a swim?” asked the cow. "It will cool you off.” The carabao happily agreed. They went off without the farmer's consent. Before swimming, they hung their skins on a tree branch. But it wasn't long till the farmer went looking for them. Upon seeing the farmer, they rushed to put on their skins. In their rush, the carabao had worn the cow's skin and the cow had worn the carabao's skin.

2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />

                            20. Unwanted Gift A young man excitedly told his father that he would be graduating with the highest honors. Aware of his hard work and the pride brought to his family, he made a request to buy him a car as a graduation gift. On graduation day, the Whole family was beaming with pride. After the day's joyful and festive celebration, the father handed his gift to his son. It was a book A bible. The young man received it but felt bitter and disappointed. Silently, he went to his room and threw it in the shelf. Later, with the family's consent, he went abroad to seek greener pastures. He stayed there for five years. But one day, he received a call informing him of his father passing away. So, with a heavy heart he returned to the Philippines. After seeing his father lying in his coffin, he went to his room and unconsciously, took the Bible that was given to him as a gift by his father. He leafed through the pages of the book till he touched a hard object inserted in it. To his surprise, he saw the key of a car, a precious gift given to him five years ago.

                            24. A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

                        <p></p>A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin  <p></p>The essay is all about the Filipino culture of smallness, particularly in their perspective towards society, geography, enterprise, industry, production, and commerce. It also explores how this culture affects their laboriousness and enterprise.Foreigners are astonished by the fact that in the Philippines, people buy and sell small quantities of goods such as one stick cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of hair pomade, or one single egg, banana, or any other item. This transaction is known as "tingi," which is the smallest degree in retail.Based on the text, a Filipino thinks that his country is a hard-working one when they compare it to other countries where shops and markets open later in the morning, and activity doesn't begin until nine or ten, and promptly ends at five P.M. in the Western countries.<br />
