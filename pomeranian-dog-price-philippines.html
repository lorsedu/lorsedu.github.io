13. Foods can be classified into three groups based on how they function in the body. These are “Go Foods, Grow Foods, and Glow Foods.” Go Foods provide our body with energy so we can move and work. An example of this is rice. Grow Foods, on the other hand, allow our bodies to build muscles and fats and repair tissues. Eggs and meat are good examples in this type. The third type, Glow Foods, help protect the body against diseases and keep it health. Fruits and vegetables, which are rich in nutrients, belong to Glow Foods.

My first experience in cooking rice was funny. I remember putting four cups of rice in a cauldron or “kaldero” and completely filling it in with a water. Then I left to play outside. When I remember about what I was cooking about an hour later, I was shocked to see and smell something strange in the kitchen.

15. Dogs can be categorized into many groups. Dogs may be wild or domesticated. Wild dogs are those which live independently in their natural habitat like the forest. Domesticated dogs, on the other hand, are those which have been living with humans for generations. Dogs can also be classified by breed like Poodles, Bulldogs, Pomeranian, German Shepherd, Chihuahua, etc. Likewise, dogs may also be considered as a pet, a guard, or even a hunter depending on their breed.

Obbie is a six-year-old, male, toy pomeranian whereas marcee is a one-year-old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. on the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone shet meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is acolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their life, hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do.1.____________________________________________________________2.___________________________________________________________3.___________________________________________________________4.___________________________________________________________5.___________________________________________________________​</a>

                                            Read the selection and explain how comparison and contrast is shown.(5 points each)Example:1. An experiment with dogs suggests that our canine pals, much like ourselves, differ in their attitude toward life: Some dogs are pessimists while others appear to be optimists. In an experiment at a British veterinary school, researchers placed bowls of food in a regular location and got dogs used to finding their dinner there. The researchers then placed a consistently empty bowl in a separate location with a second, food-filled bowl placed between the two. Some dogs, when led to the empty bowl, would just give up if no food was present. These were the pessimists. The optimists, however, having experienced a reward on previous occasions, would keep looking and eventually locate the bowl in the middle. The dogs labeled pessimistic also grew anxious if separated from their owners. They would bark, chew things, and urinate inappropriately. The optimistic dogs, however, tended to fall asleep when left alone. They also greeted strangers as possible substitute playmates. In contrast, the pessimistic dogs would react to strangers with fear and aggression. Answer; Some dogs are optimists and some are pessimists. They differ in several ways.2. There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment. This process is known as photosynthesis. In contrast, animals, including man, get their food either directly from plants or indirectly by eating animals which have eaten plants. Plants are generally stationary. Animals, on the other hand, can usually move about. In external appearance, plants are usually green. They grow in a branching fashion at their extremities, and their growth continues throughout their lives. Animals, however, are very diverse in their external appearance. Their growth pattern is not limited to their extremities. It is evenly distributed and only occurs in a definite time period. Therefore, the difference between plants and animals is quite significant Answer:3. Although I raised Marcee and Obbie since they were puppies, they have completely diverse personalities. Obbie is a six- year old, male, toy Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one- year old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. On the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone she meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is scolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their lives, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. Answer:​</a>

                            4. 1. Clemens, Lieselotte.Kiel, West Germany: Pomeranian Foundation, 1976.Old Lutheran Emigration from Pomerania to the U.S.A.: History and Motivation, 1839-1843.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Originally this name was applied to Lutherans who refused to join in the Prussian Union. There was a similar reaction against unionism and rationalism in Saxony. Old Lutherans continued in Germany and Poland under various names including Altlutheraner; Breslauer Synode; Verein der evangelisch-altlutherischen Kirchengemeinden; Evangelisch-luth. Kirche in Westpolen; Evangelisch Kirche in Preussen, later &amp; Evangelisch-luth. Kirche in Altpreussen, and since 1945 Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche. The name Old Lutherans was also applied to confessional Lutherans who emigrated to America 1838–48 under such men as J.A.A. Grabau and M. Stephan.
</p><p>
</p><p>Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III united the Reformed (Calvinist) and Lutheran churches in 1817 on the 300th anniversary of the Reformation.  A new church liturgy was introduced in 1827, and by 1829 there was a threat of a fine if this liturgy was not used in Pomeranian churches.  Initially about 2000 Lutherans and a growing number of clergy resisted this new Union church.  They formed the Free Lutheran Church in June 1830.  This group went by many names such as Breslau Synod and the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Prussia. The nickname Alt Lutherans (Old Lutherans) came about after about 1845.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the Lutheran dominated areas of Saxony, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania, it was feared that Lutheran beliefs were being replaced with Reformed doctrines.  Lutheran church services were banned, and clergy not accepting the Union liturgy were dismissed or arrested.  Children were to be sent to Union schools, and money was to be paid to support Union pastors even if they didn't attend Union services. Secret Lutheran services were held in homes, barns, forests, or quarries.
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1835 a group of dissenters took refuge in Kreise Cammin, Stolp, and Greifenberg.  The group began discussions to emigrate to the United States to have religious freedom. In response to this threat to emigrate, the Prussian government became more lenient in 1842. The first group of Old Lutherans still decided to emigrate in 1843.
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1837 other Old Lutherans from Kreis Naugard and Kreis Cammin left for America.  In 1838 a new decree stated that the Old Lutherans could emigrate only if they took with them a like-minded pastor.  In 1838 a small number applied for permission to leave from the island of Wollin. In 1839, 622 Pomeranians left, 52 of these without permission. None left in 1840, but in 1841 92 left from Kreis Cammin and another 45 in 1842. A larger group of 1,017 Pomeranians left in 1843.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

13. Foods can be classified into three groups based on how they function in the body. These are “Go Foods, Grow Foods, and Glow Foods.” Go Foods provide our body with energy so we can move and work. An example of this is rice. Grow Foods, on the other hand, allow our bodies to build muscles and fats and repair tissues. Eggs and meat are good examples in this type. The third type, Glow Foods, help protect the body against diseases and keep it health. Fruits and vegetables, which are rich in nutrients, belong to Glow Foods.

My first experience in cooking rice was funny. I remember putting four cups of rice in a cauldron or “kaldero” and completely filling it in with a water. Then I left to play outside. When I remember about what I was cooking about an hour later, I was shocked to see and smell something strange in the kitchen.

                            15. Read the selection and explain how comparison and contrast is shown.(5 points each)Example:1. An experiment with dogs suggests that our canine pals, much like ourselves, differ in their attitude toward life: Some dogs are pessimists while others appear to be optimists. In an experiment at a British veterinary school, researchers placed bowls of food in a regular location and got dogs used to finding their dinner there. The researchers then placed a consistently empty bowl in a separate location with a second, food-filled bowl placed between the two. Some dogs, when led to the empty bowl, would just give up if no food was present. These were the pessimists. The optimists, however, having experienced a reward on previous occasions, would keep looking and eventually locate the bowl in the middle. The dogs labeled pessimistic also grew anxious if separated from their owners. They would bark, chew things, and urinate inappropriately. The optimistic dogs, however, tended to fall asleep when left alone. They also greeted strangers as possible substitute playmates. In contrast, the pessimistic dogs would react to strangers with fear and aggression. Answer; Some dogs are optimists and some are pessimists. They differ in several ways.2. There are several characteristics which distinguish plants from animals. Green plants are able to manufacture their own food from substances in the environment. This process is known as photosynthesis. In contrast, animals, including man, get their food either directly from plants or indirectly by eating animals which have eaten plants. Plants are generally stationary. Animals, on the other hand, can usually move about. In external appearance, plants are usually green. They grow in a branching fashion at their extremities, and their growth continues throughout their lives. Animals, however, are very diverse in their external appearance. Their growth pattern is not limited to their extremities. It is evenly distributed and only occurs in a definite time period. Therefore, the difference between plants and animals is quite significant Answer:3. Although I raised Marcee and Obbie since they were puppies, they have completely diverse personalities. Obbie is a six- year old, male, toy Pomeranian whereas Marcee is a one- year old, female, Boston terrier. Obbie is small and soft, unlike Marcee who has bristly hair and is much bigger. Marcee insists on sleeping on the bed, under the covers every night. On the other hand, Obbie will only sleep on the floor, under the bed. Obbie is tremendously loyal and uptight; however, Marcee is hyper and friendly to anyone she meets or sees. Around other dogs, Marcee cowers to the larger dog, yet Obbie will always stand his ground, never giving up until he is scolded. Given that they were both treated the same way all their lives, it is hard to believe that they are so different in everything they do. Answer:​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sample Comparison Paragraph</p><p>    There are three important similarities between The Eastern Woodland Peoples and the Northwest Coast Peoples. First of all, neither group had a written language. The Iroquois relied on oral storytelling to recall their history. Similarly, The Nootka used totem poles and spoken words to tell their story. A second similarity is the way these First Nations traveled in their territory. Both groups relied on canoes- birch bark in the east and cedar in the west. Finally, like the majority of First Nations, both had a respect for nature not found in Western cultures. For example, during a hunt, the hunter would make an offering to the dead animal. He thanked the animal for giving up his life. He hoped the animal would let the other animals know of his generosity so that they would give their lives in the future. In sum, there are many commonalities among first nations despite diverse environments and great distances.</p><br />
