Take note that some statements are technically opinions, but are based on such widely accepted views of few people1. Eid is a religious festival celebrated by Muslims twice a year2. Chinese New Year is also known as Spring Festival.3. Personally, I think upholding our cultural practices through fiestas should be preserved for future generations4. Although widely celebrated, some find festivities impractical and expensive.5. In the Philippines, celebrating fiestas is still common.6. Old folks say that Catholic fiestas are celebrated to express their gratitude to the Lord through the intercession of the saints for a fruitful year.7. The procession on the Feast of the Black Nazarene takes place every year on the 9th of January.8. Thousands of devotees come to Quiapo to partake in the Traslacion, the procession to commemorate the transfer of the Black Nazarene image from Intramuros to Quiapo Church9. Absolutely, Traslacion is one of my most favorite religious celebrations in the country10. It is my belief that festivities like the Traslacion should be regarded as cultural identity markersof different races.11. Ice cream is the most delicious food.12. All living things need water to survive13. Roses are prettier than daisies.14. Baguio is the summer capital of the Philippines15.

Last December 2017, my friend and I visited Cebu for the first time. We flew from Clark International Airport to Mactan-Cebu International Airport. It was a short yet exciting flight as it was the first time we flew together. When we arrived in Mactan, it was already raining very hard. Getting a ride to the city was not easy, but we did not take it as a problem because we were very excited. When we arrived in the city, we saw what a beautiful place it was and met many wonderfully hospitable people. It was just a typical city with many taxis, jeepneys, buses, malls and establishments, but we were still thrilled to look around. Some people there speak Filipino and English, but most of them speak Cebuano. Luckily, my friend and I understood them well so it was not difficult to ask them whenever necessary while we were touring around. The varieties of food in Cebu are amazing, especially the lechon which the city is most popular for. Lechon was quite expensive, but it was worth spending money for because it was very savory compared to other lechons my friend and I have tasted back home. During our stay, we went around the city, visited churches, temples and flower gardens, and saw beautiful sights at night. We stayed there for a week, but it felt so short so we promised to each other that we will go back to Cebu to do more exciting activities together. 2.

                            4. Learning Task 1: Write FACT if you can prove or disprove the statement with concrete evidence, or OPINION if thestatement is a belief or a position. Take note that some statements are technically opinions, but are based on such widely accepted views of few people1. Eid is a religious festival celebrated by Muslims twice a year2. Chinese New Year is also known as Spring Festival.3. Personally, I think upholding our cultural practices through fiestas should be preserved for future generations4. Although widely celebrated, some find festivities impractical and expensive.5. In the Philippines, celebrating fiestas is still common.6. Old folks say that Catholic fiestas are celebrated to express their gratitude to the Lord through the intercession of the saints for a fruitful year.7. The procession on the Feast of the Black Nazarene takes place every year on the 9th of January.8. Thousands of devotees come to Quiapo to partake in the Traslacion, the procession to commemorate the transfer of the Black Nazarene image from Intramuros to Quiapo Church9. Absolutely, Traslacion is one of my most favorite religious celebrations in the country10. It is my belief that festivities like the Traslacion should be regarded as cultural identity markersof different races.11. Ice cream is the most delicious food.12. All living things need water to survive13. Roses are prettier than daisies.14. Baguio is the summer capital of the Philippines15. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example,by coughing into a flexed elbow).​</h2><br />

Last December 2017, my friend and I visited Cebu for the first time. We flew from Clark International Airport to Mactan-Cebu International Airport. It was a short yet exciting flight as it was the first time we flew together. When we arrived in Mactan, it was already raining very hard. Getting a ride to the city was not easy, but we did not take it as a problem because we were very excited. When we arrived in the city, we saw what a beautiful place it was and met many wonderfully hospitable people. It was just a typical city with many taxis, jeepneys, buses, malls and establishments, but we were still thrilled to look around. Some people there speak Filipino and English, but most of them speak Cebuano. Luckily, my friend and I understood them well so it was not difficult to ask them whenever necessary while we were touring around. The varieties of food in Cebu are amazing, especially the lechon which the city is most popular for. Lechon was quite expensive, but it was worth spending money for because it was very savory compared to other lechons my friend and I have tasted back home. During our stay, we went around the city, visited churches, temples and flower gardens, and saw beautiful sights at night. We stayed there for a week, but it felt so short so we promised to each other that we will go back to Cebu to do more exciting activities together. 2.

First, Filipinos are very respectful and obedient to anyone older than them as compared to Americans who may find these traits shocking. Second, Filipinos are very family-centered and dependent on one another which is why they have extended family ties. In contrast, Americans are very independent which is why they already let the teenagers in the family to work for themselves. Third, Filipinos are very subtle, non-confrontational and generally optimistic that no matter how difficult life's challenges are, they still opt​</h2><br />
